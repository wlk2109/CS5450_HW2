Things to think about:

1. SENDING MESSAGES
    This is the first priority
2. Tracking (vector clock)
3. Dishing the Goss
4. Anti-Entropy
    10 second timer (alarm with sig handler)
    Can 2 seperate programs (gbn and p2p have 2 seperate signals?)
5. Message Struct
    This is mostly taken care of
6. Chat Log
    Implementation?
    Just a string array? (hash table would be nice)
7. Vector Clock
    uint_16t array. Each column is a peer.
8. Calls from proxy
    Msg - Send a message
    Start - Start a process
    Get ChatLog - sends a request for chat log to the local server
    exit - exit all
    crash - Crash!
9. Some tests:
    Gossip
    Consistent chat logs
    crashing.
